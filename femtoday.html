Bejing 2016: One year ago, Li Tingting and a group of feminists were detained by authorities in China on International Womens' Day.
Li and four other women were detained on March 7, 2015, for planning to hand out leaflets the following day warning about groping 
on public transit. The incident caused a public uproar. The hashtag #freethefive trended on social media. Li Tingting stands strong, 
sharing a photo of herself dressed as Rosie the Riveter one year after the incident. However, the charges against the women still stand 
today. The womens' lawyers issued a joint statement adressed to the Supreme People's Procuratorate and the National People's Congress.
"From then until now, not a single legal body of state has answered our questions." Said a lawyer for one of the women.
On March 1, 2016, China's first law against domestic violence took effect. Li looks at the new law as a sign of progress.
"Like all social movements, the Chinese feminist movement has experienced climaxes and bottoms," wrote Li. "Although it is greatly 
restrained at the present, we believe that the feminism activists in China will promote it with our wisdome and brave heart."
