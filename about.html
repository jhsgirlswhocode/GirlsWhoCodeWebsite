Welcome to the Feminism Site, designed and run by Juanita High School's Girls Who Code. Established in December 2015, our chapter of this national organization aims to spread awareness about women in the tech industry through the art of coding.
</p>
<p> 
Girls Who Code, an organization founded by Reshma Saujani, introduces computer science to girls all around the nation in all forms, including programming fundamentals, web development and design, mobile development, and robotics. By doing so, their exposure to real-world technology companies is unsurpassed by few.
